# Authenitcation is done by connecting the service account set up on the cloud.google.com
#     console and set up with domain-wide authority in on the admin panel. This is what
#     open() does. As we are doing sensitive admin work, we need to impersonate a superadmin,
#     which is what .with_subject does.

# This then needs to be built into a service object that actually makes the call. This is
#     done (for the gmail API, version 1)
#         self._service = build("gmail", "v1", credentials=_creds)

# API calls are done by specifiying which API wr're using, and calling the HTTP request like
#           email_attempt = (
#               self._service.users()
#               .messages()
#               .send(userId="me", body=encoded_package)
#               .execute()
#           )
#     Here we use the service object to access the groups API, run a get function giving it
#     what it asks for in the documentation, and actually calling it by .excecute().
