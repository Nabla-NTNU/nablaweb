"""
A hack to be able to load easy_thumbnails templatetags using
{% load easy_thumbnails %}
instead of
{% lead thumbnail %}.

The reason for doing this is that sorl.thumbnail and easy_thumbnails both
name their templatetag module 'thumbnail' and one gets conflicts.
The reason for using both thumbnail libraries is that they are used in different apps on pypi.
